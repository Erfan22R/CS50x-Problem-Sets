# CS50x - Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course.

Throughout this course, I completed various problem sets covering algorithms, memory, data structures, and web development.  
All solutions were written independently as part of my learning journey.

## Problem Sets

- Problem Set 0 - Scratch
- Problem Set 1 - C Programming: Mario, Cash, Credit
- Problem Set 2 - Arrays, Algorithms: Readability, Caesar, Substitution
- Problem Set 3 - Algorithms: Tideman, Plurality, Runoff
- Problem Set 4 - Memory: Filter, Recover
- Problem Set 5 - Data Structures: Speller
- Problem Set 6 - Python: Sentimental
- Problem Set 7 - SQL: Movies
- Problem Set 8 - Web Programming: Homepage
- Problem Set 9 - Flask App
- Problem Set 10 - Final Project (separate repository)
